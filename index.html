        <p>Warframe is a free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter video game developed and published by Digital Extremes. Originally released for Microsoft Windows in March 2013, it was later ported to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. In Warframe, players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep to find themselves at war in a planetary system with different factions. The Tenno use their powered Warframes along with powerful weapons and abilities to complete missions. While many of the game's missions use procedurally-generated levels, newer updates have included large open world areas similar to other massively multiplayer online games. The game includes elements of shooting and melee games, parkour, and role-playing to allow players to advance their Tenno character with improved gear.</p>

        Warframe is a free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter video game developed and published by Digital Extremes. Originally released for Microsoft Windows in March 2013, it was later ported to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. In Warframe, players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep to find themselves at war in a planetary system with different factions.

    <p>
        The concepts for Warframe had been in place at Digital Extremes since 2000 under the name Dark Sector. The company reintroduced Dark Sector in 2004 in preparation for release on the upcoming seventh generation consoles but could not find a publisher due to its theme. Ultimately Digital Extremes released a game called Dark Sector in 2008, far different from their original plan. By 2012, looking at the success of free-to-play games, the developers took their earlier Dark Sector ideas and art assets, to present it as Warframe.
    </p>

    <p>
        Warframe initially had a slow start due to moderate reviews and low player counts, but Digital Extremes worked with dedicated fans of the game to continue to improve it, helping to grow its player base. Five years since the open beta, the game has seen more than 38 million players by 2018 and is one of Digital Extremes' most successful titles with new content and game modes being added. The game has won game of the year twice. The game is supported by microtransactions that allow players to purchase various in-game items that are otherwise available through grinding.

        <h2>Story</h2>

        <p>
            They were called Tenno. Warriors of blade and gun: masters of the Warframe armor. Those that survived the old war were left drifting among the ruins. Now they are needed once more.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Grineer, with their vast armies, are spreading throughout the solar system. A call echoes across the stars summoning the Tenno to an ancient place. They summon you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Allow the Lotus to guide you. She has rescued you from your cryostasis chamber and given you a chance to survive. The Grineer will find you; you must be prepared. The Lotus will teach you the ways of the Warframes and the secrets to unlocking their powers.
        </p>
        <p>
            COME TENNO, YOU MUST JOIN THE WAR.

        <p>The Warframe is an advanced weapons system used exclusively by the Tenno in their missions throughout the Origin System. The Warframes possess regenerative shields, greatly enhanced mobility, and enable the use of an array of supernatural abilities – all of which further augment the Tenno's deadly use of traditional combat arts.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Warframes are divided into a collection of diverse models, each of which personifies a great warrior spirit. Players may don the Excalibur Warframe to gain its prowess with bladed weapons, for instance. Each model of Warframe is moreover highly reconfigurable, meaning players can tailor their choice of Warframe to fit a multitude of playstyles. While certain Warframes excel in a particular situation, none are limited to a singular role and no role demands the use of a singular Warframe.</p>
        <p>Players customize Warframes via the installation of mods which can upgrade their Warframe Attributes, endow them with additional utilities, and even alter their abilities. Further bonuses can be achieved by equipping add-ons, such as Arcane Helmets.</p>
        <div class="over-div-img">
            <p>Each Warframe features four unique and extraordinary activatable powers that allow for a large degree of control over the surrounding environment. (Warframes also possess passive abilities – powers which activate on their own accord.) These powers allow a Tenno to cast virtually anything, with examples ranging from devastating waves of energy to bullet-nullifying barriers or even mass healing. Warframes greatly augment the physical abilities of a Tenno as well, affecting natural skills like swordsmanship, marksmanship and, most notably, acrobatics.
                New players start the game by selecting their first Warframe, from the Excalibur, Mag, or Volt Warframes, and playing through the tutorial. As the player progresses, they may craft or buy other Warframes from the full list of offerings.</p>

Erupt caustic pustules to spread her disease, shed deceptive husks to draw enemy fire, as she injects lethal venom and exhales deadly viruses to cleanse the System with her toxic touch. Saryn blossomed in Update 7. </p>
